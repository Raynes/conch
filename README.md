# conch

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Raynes/conch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Raynes/conch)

Conch is actually two libraries. The first, `conch.core` is a simple low-level
interface to the Java process APIs. The second and more interesting library is
an interface to `conch.core` inspired by the Python
[sh](http://amoffat.github.com/sh/) library.

The general idea is to be able to call programs just like you would call Clojure
functions. See Usage for examples.

## Installation

In Leiningen:

```clojure
:dependencies [[me.raynes/conch "0.4.0"]]
```

## Usage

First of all, let's `require` a few things.

```clojure
user> (require '[conch.sh :refer [programs with-programs let-programs]])
nil
```

Let's call a program. What should we call? Let's call `echo`, because I
obviously like to hear myself talk.

```clojure
user> (programs echo)
#'user/echo
user> (echo "Hi!")
"Hi!\n"
```

Cool! `programs` is a simple macro that takes a number of symbols and creates
functions that calls programs on the PATH with those names. `echo` is now just a
normal function defined with `defn` just like any other.

`with-programs` and `let-programs` are lexical and specialized versions of
`programs`. `with-programs` is exactly the same as `programs`, only it defines
functions lexically:

```clojure
user> (with-programs [ls] (ls))
"#README.md#\nREADME.md\nclasses\ndocs\nfoo.py\nlib\nlol\npom.xml\npom.xml.asc\nproject.clj\nsrc\ntarget\ntest\ntestfile\n"
user> ls
CompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resolve symbol: ls in
this context, compiling:(NO_SOURCE_PATH:1) 
```

`let-programs` is similar, but is useful for when you want to specify a path to
a program that is not on the PATH:

```clojure
user> (let-programs [echo "/bin/echo"] (echo "hi!"))
"hi!\n"
```

Bad example since `echo` *is* on the path, but if it wasn't there already it
still would have worked. I promise.

### Input

You can pass input to a program easily:

```clojure
user> (programs cat)
#'user/cat
user> (cat {:in "hi"})
"hi"
user> (cat {:in ["hi" "there"]})
"hi\nthere\n"
user> (cat {:in (java.io.StringReader. "hi")})
"hi"
```

`:in` is handled by a protocol and can thus be extended to support other data.

### Output

So, going back to our `ls` example. Of course, `ls` gives us a bunch of
lines. In a lot of cases, we're going to want to process lines individually. We
can do that by telling conch that we want a lazy seq of lines instead of a
monolithic string:

```clojure
user> (ls {:seq true})
("#README.md#" "README.md" "classes" "docs" "foo.py" "lib" "lol" "pom.xml"
"pom.xml.asc" "project.clj" "src" "target" "test" "testfile")
```

We can also redirect output to other places.

```clojure
user> (let [writer (java.io.StringWriter.)] (echo "foo" {:out writer}) (str writer))
"foo\n"
user> (echo "foo" {:out (java.io.File. "conch")})
nil
user> (slurp "conch")
"foo\n"
```

And if that wasn't cool enough for you, `:out` is handled by a protocol and thus
can be extended.

### Need Moar INNNNPUUUUUUT

Need the exit code and stuff? Sure:

```clojure
user> (echo "foo" {:verbose true})
{:proc {:out ("foo\n"), :in #<ProcessPipeOutputStream
java.lang.UNIXProcess$ProcessPipeOutputStream@19c12ee7>, :err (), :process
#<UNIXProcess java.lang.UNIXProcess@2bfabe2a>}, :exit-code
#<core$future_call$reify__6110@5adacdf4: 0>, :stdout "foo\n", :stderr ""}
```

### Timeouts

```clojure
user> (sleep "5")
... yawn ...
```

Tired of waiting for that pesky process to exit? Make it go away!

```clojure
user> (sleep "5" {:timeout 2000})
... two seconds later ...
""
```

Much better.

### Piping

You can pipe the output of one program as the input to another about how you'd
expect:

```clojure
user> (programs grep ps)
#'user/ps
user> (grep "ssh" {:in (ps "-e" {:seq true})})
" 4554 ??         0:00.77 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -l\n"
```

These functions also look for a lazy seq arg, so you can get rid of the explicit
`:in` part.

```clojure
user> (programs grep ps)
#'user/ps
user> (grep "ssh" (ps "-e" {:seq true}))
" 4554 ??         0:00.77 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -l\n"
```

### Buffering

Conch gets rid of some ugly edge-cases by **always reading process output
immediately when it becomes available**. It buffer this data into a queue that
you consume however you want. This is how returning lazy seqs work. Keep in mind
that if you don't consume data, it is being held in memory.

You can change how conch buffers data using the `:buffer` key.

```clojure
user> (ls {:seq true :buffer 5})
("#READ" "ME.md" "#\nREA" "DME.m" "d\ncla" "sses\n" "conch" "\ndocs" "\nfoo." "py\nli" "b\nlol" "\npom." "xml\np" "om.xm" "l.asc" "\nproj" "ect.c" "lj\nsr" "c\ntar" "get\nt" "est\nt" "estfi" "le\n")
user> (ls {:seq true :buffer :none})
(\# \R \E \A \D \M \E \. \m \d \# \newline \R \E \A \D \M \E \. \m \d \newline
\c \l \a \s \s \e \s \newline \c \o \n \c \h \newline \d \o \c \s \newline \f \o
\o \. \p \y \newline \l \i \b \newline \l \o \l \newline \p \o \m \. \x \m \l
\newline \p \o \m \. \x \m \l \. \a \s \c \newline \p \r \o \j \e \c \t \. \c \l
\j \newline \s \r \c \newline \t \a \r \g \e \t \newline \t \e \s \t \newline \t
\e \s \t \f \i \l \e \newline)
```

Another nice thing gained by the way conch consumes data is that it is able to
kill a process after a timeout and keep whatever data it has already consumed.


### PTY stuff

PTY stuff seems like it'd be a lot of work and would involve non-Clojure
stuff. If you need a PTY for output, I suggest wrapping your programs in
'unbuffer' from the expect package. It usually does the trick for unbuffering
program output by making it think a terminal is talking to it.

## Low Level Usage

Conch is pretty simple. You spin off a process with `proc`.

```clojure
user=> (def p (sh/proc "cat"))
#'user/p
user=> p
{:out #<BufferedInputStream java.io.BufferedInputStream@5809fdee>, :in #<BufferedOutputStream java.io.BufferedOutputStream@5ebbfa5c>, :err #<DeferredCloseInputStream java.lang.UNIXProcess$DeferredCloseInputStream@58e5f46e>, :process #<UNIXProcess java.lang.UNIXProcess@18f42160>}
```

When you create a process with `proc`, you get back a map containing the
keys `:out`, `:err`, `:in`, and `:proc`.

* `:out` is the process's stdout.
* `:err` is the process's stderr.
* `:in` is the process's stdin.
* `:process` is the process object itself.

Conch is more flexible than `clojure.java.shell` because you have direct
access to all of the streams and the process object itself.

So, now we have a cat process. This is a unix tool. If you
run `cat` with no arguments, it echos whatever you type in. This makes it
perfect for testing input and output.

Conch defines a few utility functions for streaming output and feeding
input. Since we want to make sure that our input is going to the right
place, let's set up a way to see the output of our process in realtime:

```clojure
user=> (future (sh/stream-to-out p :out))
#<core$future_call$reify__5684@77b5c22f: :pending>
```

The `stream-to-out` function takes a process and either `:out` or `:err`
and streams that to `System/out`. In this case, it has the effect of printing
everything we pipe into our cat process, since our cat process just
outputs whatever we input.

```clojure
user=> (sh/feed-from-string p "foo\n")
nil
foo
```

The `feed-from-string` function just feeds a string to the process. It
automatically flushes (which is why this prints immediately) but you can
stop it from doing that by passing `:flush false`.

I think our cat process has lived long enough. Let's kill it and get its
exit code. We can use the `exit-code` function to get the exit code.
However, since `exit-code` stops the thread and waits for the process to
terminate, we should run it in a future until we actually destroy the
process.

```clojure
user=> (def exit (future (sh/exit-code p)))
#'user/exit
```

Now let's kill. R.I.P process.

```clojure
user=> (sh/destroy p)
nil
```

And the exit code, which we should be able to obtain now that the
process has been terminated:

```clojure
user=> @exit
0
```

Awesome! Let's go back to `proc` and see what else we can do with it. We
can pass multiple strings to `proc`. The first string will be considered
the executable and the rest of them the arguments to that executable.

```clojure
user=> (sh/proc "ls" "-l")
{:out #<BufferedInputStream java.io.BufferedInputStream@7fb6634c>, :in #<BufferedOutputStream java.io.BufferedOutputStream@1f315415>, :err #<DeferredCloseInputStream java.lang.UNIXProcess$DeferredCloseInputStream@5f873eb2>, :process #<UNIXProcess java.lang.UNIXProcess@2825491d>}
```

Here is an easy way to get the output of a one-off process like this as
a string:

```clojure
user=> (sh/stream-to-string (sh/proc "ls" "-l") :out)
"total 16\n-rw-r--r--  1 anthony  staff  2545 Jan 24 16:37 README.md\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 anthony  staff    68 Jan 19 19:23 classes\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 anthony  staff   102 Jan 19 19:23 lib\n-rw-r--r--  1 anthony  staff   120 Jan 20 14:45 project.clj\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 anthony  staff   102 Jan 20 14:45 src\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 anthony  staff   102 Jan 19 16:36 test\n"
```

Let's print that for readability:

```clojure
user=> (print (sh/stream-to-string (sh/proc "ls" "-l") :out))
total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 anthony  staff  2545 Jan 24 16:37 README.md
drwxr-xr-x  2 anthony  staff    68 Jan 19 19:23 classes
drwxr-xr-x  3 anthony  staff   102 Jan 19 19:23 lib
-rw-r--r--  1 anthony  staff   120 Jan 20 14:45 project.clj
drwxr-xr-x  3 anthony  staff   102 Jan 20 14:45 src
drwxr-xr-x  3 anthony  staff   102 Jan 19 16:36 test
nil
```

So, that's the `ls` of the current directory. I ran this REPL in the
conch project directory. We can, of course, pass a directory to `ls` to
get it to list the files in that directory, but that isn't any fun. We
can pass a directory to `proc` itself and it'll run in the context of
that directory.

```clojure
user=> (print (sh/stream-to-string (sh/proc "ls" "-l" :dir "lib/") :out))
total 6624
-rw-r--r--  1 anthony  staff  3390414 Jan 19 19:23 clojure-1.3.0.jar
nil
```

You can also pass a `java.io.File` or anything that can be passed to
`clojure.java.io/file`. 

We can also set environment variables:

```clojure
user=> (print (sh/stream-to-string (sh/proc "env" :env {"FOO" "bar"}) :out))
FOO=bar
nil
```

The map passed to `:env` completely replaces any other environment
variables that were in place.

Finally, there a couple of low-level functions for streaming from and
feeding to a process. They are `stream-to` and `feed-from`. These
functions are what the utility functions are built off of, and you can
probably use them to stream to and feed from your own special places.

You might want to fire off a program that listens for input until EOF.
In these cases, you can feed it data for as long as you want and just
tell it when you are done. Let's use `pygmentize` as an example:

```clojure
user=> (def proc (sh/proc "pygmentize" "-fhtml" "-lclojure"))
#'user/proc
user=> (sh/feed-from-string proc "(+ 3 3)")
nil
user=> (sh/done proc)
nil
user=> (sh/stream-to-string proc :out)
"<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">+ </span><span class=\"mi\">3</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n"
```

When we call `done`, it closes the process's output stream which is
like sending EOF. The process processes its input and then puts it on
its input stream where we read it with `stream-to-string`.

### Other options

All of conch's streaming and feeding functions (including the lower
level ones) pass all of their keyword options to `clojure.java.io/copy`.
It can take an `:encoding` and `:buffer-size` option. Guess what they
do.

### Key names

You might notice that the map that `proc` returns is mapped like so:

* `:in`  -> output stream
* `:out` -> input stream

I did this because swapping them feels counterintuitive. The output
stream is what you put `:in` to and the input stream is what you pull
`:out` from.
